Papers relating to Alignment
## 1 : Alignment is Hard
Project Started in 2022. Project funded in august 2023. Readable draft was put on github in november 2023.
In June 2024, I decided to write less verbose draft.

## 2: Control By Committee
Back in 2018 and 2019, I was thinking of aligning AIs by forming multi-agent structures.
In October and November 2025, I am going to at least attempt this research direction of alignment of ensembles of agents.
I will likely not continue the research into 2026 without funding and co-authors.
